This project is based on this template: https://github.com/TileDB-Inc/py-cppstring-starter

# Run code

```
git clone <uri>
cd <repo>
mkdir bld
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

```
cd bld
ls # you should see an extension like `pbstring.cpython-310-darwin.so`
python
```

Then you can run the code of an example file.
